General:

- aligned diamonds: flashing ice blocks missing last row
- demo level pengo seems to do weird things always the same move pattern

Amiga:

- cheat key for chicken
- diamond countdown sound too short, should loop
- when snobee chickens out no sound? music restarts!
- fast music when?
- clock how much time is really spent vs bonus screen time
- highscore music seems too slow
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side? shift pengo lives 2 pixels up?
- highscore screen letter flashing too fast (no speed regulation, sounds good on A1260...)
