General:

- more sounds
- aligned diamonds: flashing ice blocks missing last row
- crash when level 1 starts after level 16 (in crash)
- load/save highscores
- demo level pengo seems to do weird things
- if highscore obtained, hiscore screen doesn't seem to see it

Amiga:

- 2 lives default is bad!!
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination: check missing
- moves using keyboard arrows + ctrl
- start game up/down fire credits
- clock how much time is really spent vs bonus screen time
- complete sound
- add "trainer" player killed/game over
- tile planar optimization to save memory?
- title: wrong color for snobee that erase "squash the snobees" message
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y (would fix title screen 4 snobees)
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side? shift pengo lives 2 pixels up?
