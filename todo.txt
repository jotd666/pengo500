General:

- highscores (today's best 5) wrongly displayed
- sounds
- probable "endian bug" in scores
- lives should not be displayed in demo mode/intro screens
- play: die: maze is destroyed (color attribute vs tile mixup??)
- dipswitches easy/... test!
- start game from ice bank screen => issue (blitz)
- diamond align 2-3: detected by blinking diamonds, but bonus not triggered
  by 3 aligned diamonds (create an option to create 2 or 3 aligned diamonds
  at start or blank maze+invincible)


Amiga:

- sprite allocation is still wrong (red ice cube)  break when wrong colors, get sprite state to investigate!
- whdload cheat: complete level key, invincible
- sound
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
- title: wrong color for snobee that erase "squash the snobees" message
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y (would fix title screen 4 snobees)
- redundant bg_cluts / clut asm file
- alternate tileset: all symmetric? plus slow and wrong chars (ok in the end)
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side? shift pengo lives 2 pixels up?
