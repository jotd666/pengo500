General:

- CLUTs seem wrong: alphanum chars OK, graphic chars wrong
  (try to swap colors in cluts ex clut $0E pengo title ??)
- end transcode
- dip switches (see ** code)
- debug routine which writes "thanks for playing..." because regression!!!

Amiga:

- sprites
- sound
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
