General:

- highscore screen too fast (no speed regulation l_26d9 doesn't work)
- load/save highscores
- more sounds
- aligned diamonds: flashing ice blocks missing last row
- crash when level 1 starts after level 16 (in crash)
- demo level pengo seems to do weird things

Amiga:

- no more sound when popcorn should play / music replay to rework completely
- 2 lives default is bad!!
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination: check missing
- clock how much time is really spent vs bonus screen time
- complete sound
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side? shift pengo lives 2 pixels up?
