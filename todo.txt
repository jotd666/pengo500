General:

- dip switches (see ** code)
- highscores (today's best 5) wrongly displayed
- joystick
- sounds
- probable "endian bug" in scores
- pengo doesn't seem to be able to push blocks
- snobees are in slow "ice break" mode all the time, ice break anim
  is shown even if not ice
- lives should not be displayed in demo mode/intro screens
- play: die: maze is destroyed, unhatched eggs drawn at wrong location

Amiga:

- whdload cheat keys: complete level
- sound
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
- title: wrong color for snobee that erase "squash the snobees" message
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y (would fix title screen 4 snobees)
- redundant bg_cluts / clut asm file
- alternate tileset: all symmetric? plus slow and wrong chars (ok in the end)
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side?
