General:

- sounds
- dipswitches easy/... test!
- aligned diamonds: flashing ice blocks missing last row
- crash when level 1 starts after level 16 (in crash)
- load/save highscores

Amiga:

- moves using keyboard arrows + ctrl
- clock how much time is really spent vs bonus screen time
- complete sound
- add "trainer" player killed/game over
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
- title: wrong color for snobee that erase "squash the snobees" message
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y (would fix title screen 4 snobees)
- redundant bg_cluts / clut asm file
- alternate tileset: wrong palette for both tiles & sprites
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side? shift pengo lives 2 pixels up?
