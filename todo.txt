General:

- CLUTs seem wrong: alphanum chars OK, graphic chars wrong
  (try to swap colors in cluts ex clut $0E pengo title ??)
- dip switches (see ** code)

Amiga:

- sprites
- sound
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
- sprite allocation: when drawing a sprite try to find a free slot
  first find slot where other occupied slot has same clut, else
  find free slot
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y just in case
- redundant bg_cluts / clut asm file
- alternate tileset: all symmetric? plus slow and wrong chars (ok in the end)
