General:

- dip switches (see ** code)
- highscores (today's best 5) wrongly displayed
- joystick/insert coin
- sounds
- probable "endian bug" in scores
- pengo dead: life icon wrongly located

Amiga:

- life lost/current life: pengo life icon wrong
- if clut 0 is chosen for sprites, just hide them instead of all black!
- sprites
- sound
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
- title: wrong color for snobee that erase "squash the snobees" message
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y (would fix title screen 4 snobees)
- redundant bg_cluts / clut asm file
- alternate tileset: all symmetric? plus slow and wrong chars (ok in the end)
