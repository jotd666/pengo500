General:


Amiga:

- to avoid having 8 copies of the frames:
  Set up sprites pairs 0/1 and 2/3 to use DMA and point to the same source sprite data in RAM.
  In your copper list, wait for the sprite DMA to be read (scanline 20 on NTSC, or 25 on PAL). Then your copper lists writes SprPos/Ctrl for sprites 0,1,2,3.

- highscore screen letter flashing too fast (no speed regulation, sounds good on A1260...)
