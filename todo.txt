General:

- sounds
- dipswitches easy/... test!
- start game from ice bank screen => issue (blitz)
- aligned diamonds: flashing ice blocks missing last row
- crash when level 1 starts after level 16 (in crash)
- test player extra life award score vs dipswitches and sound (diamond align)
- regulation not correct should set flag then count loops then wait flag clear

Amiga:

- moves using keyboard arrows + ctrl
- time simulate 60Hz with ticks, clock how much time is really spent vs bonus screen time
- sprite allocation is still wrong (red ice cube/yellow pengo...)  break when wrong colors, get sprite state to investigate!
first level completed green pengo

- complete sound
- log used cluts to filter out unused clut/char combination
- tile planar optimization
- title: wrong color for snobee that erase "squash the snobees" message
- also set all 3 colors at the copperlist Y (would fix title screen 4 snobees)
- redundant bg_cluts / clut asm file
- alternate tileset: all symmetric? plus slow and wrong chars (ok in the end)
- ACT 1 + flags: draw vertically on the side? shift pengo lives 2 pixels up?
